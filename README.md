# Self-Driving-Car
This is a model which will run on Carla simulator, My goal was to control the vehicle to follow a race track by navigating through preset waypoints. The vehicle needs to reach these waypoints at certain desired speeds, so both longitudinal and lateral control will be required.
The trajectory feedback will contain the car, start and end positions, entire path/path traveled and a small shaded region which denotes the subset of interpolated points to be sent into the controller for control updates. Linear interpolation is used between waypoints to provide a finer resolution path/speed requests for the controller. 
The controls feedback shows the throttle, steering and brake outputs, as well as the speed response for the simulation (desired speed and current speed in the single plot). This is a general feedback for viewing what the client is sending to the CARLA server in terms of control commands. The desired speed is set to the closest interpolated speed point to the current position of the car. The speeds are in meters per second and the throttle (0 to 1), brake (0 to 1) and steering (-1 to 1, or left to right turn) are unitless. Note that the steering command output inside controller2d.py is automatically converted from radians (-1.22 to 1.22 rad) to a percentage (-1 to 1) before the command is sent to the CARLA server. The X axis for all four plots in the controls feedback is the in-game time, in seconds.
